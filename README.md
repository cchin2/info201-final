##   Energy Sources and CO2 in the United States
#### By: Cameron Chin, Yilun Sun, and Chaichinda Siritantitam

Our project is focused on the different production levels of **energy sources** in the United States and the amount of **CO2 emissions** for those states. We will explore how different energy types are related and the possible effects this has on CO2 emissions. We used data only from 2016 and only 20 states. Also note that **Ethanol** is a _type_ of **Bio Fuel**, and in our data, these graphs look identical. This is because all of these states pretty much only produce Ethanol as their Bio Fuel. All of our widgets are set to answer our analysis questions, but you can change them around to see other relationships if you like. If you are confused on any terms please reference the definitions to learn more!
